 Object-Oriented Programming Challenge: Team Profile Generator

This is a challenge involving the use of Node.js, Node Pack Manager (NPM), and the inquirer package to develop a Team Profile Generator that generates a sample HTML file based on user input throgh a series of Inquirer prompts.

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input,
When I am prompted for my team members and their information, then an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input.
When I click on an email address in the HTML, then my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address.
When I click on the GitHub username, then that GitHub profile opens in a new tab.
When I start the application, then I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number.
When I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number, then I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team.
When I select the engineer option, then I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu.
When I select the intern option, then I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu.
When I decide to finish building my team, then I exit the application, and the HTML is generated.
